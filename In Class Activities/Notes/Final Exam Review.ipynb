    "- The **Height** of a node in a tree is the number of edges to the most distant leaf node\n",
    "- The **Depth** of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges from that node to the root node\n",

    "### Tree Traversal\n",
    "The three main ways to traverse a binary tree are\n",
    "1. **Pre-Order**: Process data, visit left subtree, visit right subtree\n",

    "3. **Post-Order**: Visit left, subtree, visit right subtree, process data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree Properties\n",
    "- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node in the tree has either no or two child nodes\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree**: Every level of the tree is full except for the deepest level, and all the nodes in the deepest level are as left as possible\n",
    "- **Balanced Tree**: A tree is balanced if the left and right subtrees of any node have a height that differs by not more than 1\n",

The items with the highest priority are at the front of the queue and the items with the lowest priority are at the back of the queue. If an item with a high priority is enqueued, it will be stored toward (or possibly at) the front of the queue. It will thus be one of the first (or *the* first) items dequeued from the queue.\n",

    "1. **Adjacent**: two vertices $v_k$ and $v_l$ are adjacent if they are connected by an edge ($(v_k, v_l) \\in E$)\n",
    "    - Ex: vertices 4 and 6 are adjacent\n",
    "    - Ex: vertices 4 and 2 are *not* adjacent\n",
    "2. **Path**: a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination (ending) vertex\n",
    "    - Ex: a path from 1 to 6 is: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6)\n",
    "3. **Path Length**: The number of edges in the path\n",
    "    - Ex: The length of the above path is 4 edges\n",
    "4. **Distance**: The distance between two vertices is the path length for the shortest path between two vertices\n",
    "    - Ex: the shortest path from 1 to 6 is: (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6) which has a path length of 3, therefore the distance from 1 to 6 is 3\n",
    "5. **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, graphs without cycles are called *acyclic*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Graph\n",
    "Each edge in a weighted graph has an associated \"weight\" or value associated with it. This weight represents the cost to move from one vertex to another. The shortest distance between two vertices in a weighted graph is the path with the smallest edge weight, instead of the least number of edges\n",

    "### Graph Traversal Algorithms\n",
    "- **Breadth First Search**:  Makes use of a <mark style='background-color:cyan'>Queue</mark> and visits each adjacent vertex\n",
    "- **Depth First Search**: Explores the deepest path of each adjacent vertex before moving onto the next, makes use of a <mark style='background-color:cyan'>Stack</mark> and makes use of backtracking \n",
    "- Both of them have a time complexity of $O(V + E)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges"
