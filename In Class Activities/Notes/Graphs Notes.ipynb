    "# Graphs Notes\n",

    "## What is a graph?\n",
    "- A graph is an abstract data type representing nodes (vertices) and their connections (edges). It can be thought of as a generalized tree where each node can be connected to another node <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/640px-6n-graf.svg.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above graph:\n",
    "- $ V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n",
    "- $ E = \\{(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "1. **Adjacent**: two vertices $v_k$ and $v_l$ are adjacent if they are connected by an edge ($(v_k, v_l) \\in E$)\n",
    "    - Ex: vertices 4 and 6 are adjacent\n",
    "    - Ex: vertices 4 and 2 are *not* adjacent\n",
    "2. **Path**: a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination (ending) vertex\n",
    "    - Ex: a path from 1 to 6 is: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6)\n",
    "3. **Path Length**: The number of edges in the path\n",
    "    - Ex: The length of the above path is 4 edges\n",
    "4. **Distance**: The distance between two vertices is the path length for the shortest path between two vertices\n",
    "    - Ex: the shortest path from 1 to 6 is: (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6) which has a path length of 3, therefore the distance from 1 to 6 is 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Graph\n",
    "Each edge in a weighted graph has an associated \"weight\", or value associated with it. This weight represents the cost to move from one vertext to another <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/CPT-Graphs-undirected-weighted.svg\" width=\"300\"> <br>\n",
    "The above example shows the distances in miles between pairs of towns in England. In a weighted graph, the *weighted path length* is the sum of the weights of the edges in a path. For example, the path from Dunwich to Maldon: (Dunwich, Blaxhall, 15), (Blaxhall, Feering, 46), (Feering, Maldon, 11) has weight 15 + 46 + 11 = 72\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed Graph (Digraph)\n",
    "Edges in a directed graph have a \"way\" associated with them (e.g. one-way or two-way). An arrow is typically used to denote the direction of the edge <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/CPT-Graphs-directed-unweighted.svg/1000px-CPT-Graphs-directed-unweighted.svg.png\" width=\"300\"> <br>\n",
    "The above example shows that it is easy to get between Dunwich and Blaxhall, but could be quite long to get between Feering and Tiptree, depending on the direction of travel! Tiptree to Feering is one edge away, but Feering to Tiptree is two edges away.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Digraph Cycle\n",
    "A path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called a *cycle*. In the above example, there are several cycles. For example:\n",
    "* Feering, Maldon, Tiptree\n",
    "* Maldon, Tiptree, Clacton\n",
    "* Feering, Maldon, Tiptree, Clacton, Harwich, Tiptree, Feering\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs without cycles are called *acyclic* graphs. An directed, acyclic graph is called a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Digraph\n",
    "A graph can be both directed and weighted <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/CPT-Graphs-directed-weighted.svg/200px-CPT-Graphs-directed-weighted.svg.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "Vertices in a graph ADT store a value, called the key, that names the vertex. Edges represent relationships/connections amongst the keys. The interface of a graph ADT includes the following constructor, methods, and operators: \n",
    "1. `Graph()` creates a new, empty graph.\n",
    "1. `add_vertex(vert)` adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.\n",
    "1. `add_edge(from_vert, to_vert)` adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "1. `add_edge(from_vert, to_vert, weight)` adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "1. `get_vertex(vert_key)` finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.\n",
    "1. `get_vertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "1. `in` returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise."

    "## Graph Implementation\n",
    "We are going to cover two different implementations\n",
    "1. Adjacency matrices\n",
    "2. Adjacency lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjacency Matrices\n",
    "An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional matrix were each vertex $v_{i}$ is assigned row $i$ and column $i$. If two vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are adjacent, then there is a 1 in the $i$ th row and $j$ th column in the matrix. If two vertices are not adjacent, then a 0 is placed in the respective row and column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example graph: \n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/640px-6n-graf.svg.png\" width=\"300\">\n",

    "   |1|2|3|4|5|6|\n",
    "|-||-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|\n",
    "|2|1|0|1|0|1|0|\n",
    "|3|0|1|0|1|0|0|\n",
    "|4|0|0|1|0|1|1|\n",
    "|5|1|1|0|1|0|0|\n",
    "|6|0|0|0|1|0|0|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And using lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "amatrix = [[0,1,0,0,1,0],\n",
    "           [1,0,1,0,1,0],\n",
    "           [0,1,0,1,0,0],\n",
    "           [0,0,1,0,1,1],\n",
    "           [1,1,0,1,0,0],\n",
    "           [0,0,0,1,0,0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out if two vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are adjacent, we simply need to look up if there is a one in `amatrix[i][j]`, which is constant time $\\mathcal{O(1)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this matrix is the number of vertices squared, which can be quite large. Adjacency matrices with the majority of the entries 0 is said to be *sparse* and is not an effective use of memory. This shortcoming be overcome with a [*sparse matrix* representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Storing_a_sparse_matrix), such as adjacency lists. As we will say, we trade off space for lookup time complexity."

    "## Adjacency Lists\n",
    "An adjacency list is a list of vertices where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices. Each vertex in the list of adjacent vertices represents an edge. \n",

    "         5: [1, 2, 4],\n",
    "         6: [4]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this dictionary is the number of vertices (keys) plus two times the number of edges (each edge appears once in the graph but is stored as a list value twice). To find out if two vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are adjacent, we simply need to look up $v_{i}$, walk through each item in $v_{i}$'s edge list, looking for $v_{j}$. In the worst case, $v_{i}$ is fully connected to every other vertex in the graph and this list traversal is $\\mathcal{O(V)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Weighted Graphs\n",
    "In the case of a weighted graph, we need to store additional information for each edge, the weight! With the adjacency matrix, we either need to store an object (such as a tuple or an instance of a custom `Vertex` class) instead of 1 or we need to maintain a parallel matrix with this information. With the adjacency list, we can modify our keys to be instances of a custom `Vertex` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Vertex` class will store the name of the vertex and a dictionary of adjacent vertex names (keys) and edge weights (values). Then, the adjacency list is a dictionary of vertex names (keys) and `Vertex` objects (values). We will define a `Graph` class to wrap this adjacency list dictionary with our graph ADT methods:\n",
    "1. `add_vertex(vert)` adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.\n",
    "1. `add_edge(from_vert, to_vert)` adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "1. `add_edge(from_vert, to_vert, weight)` adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "1. `get_vertex(vert_key)` finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.\n",
    "1. `get_vertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
